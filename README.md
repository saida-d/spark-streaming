# üöÄ Spark Structured Streaming with JSON ‚Üí Delta Lake

This project demonstrates how to build a **Spark Structured Streaming pipeline** that:

- Reads JSON data from a landing zone
- Uses two types of triggers:
  - **Trigger Once** ‚Üí batch-style micro-batch (runs once and stops)
  - **Continuous Trigger (10 seconds)** ‚Üí continuously checks for new files every 10s
- Writes output in **Delta Lake format**
- Uses a **checkpoint location** for fault tolerance and exactly-once guarantees
